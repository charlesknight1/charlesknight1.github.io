Welcome to my personal website.

I'm a DPhil candidate in the University of Oxford's School of Geography and the Environment. My research focuses on the dynamics and variability of the Southern African summer monsoon onset.

Here you can find my [publications](https://charlesknight1.github.io/publications/), [projects](https://charlesknight1.github.io/projects/) and [fieldwork](https://charlesknight1.github.io/fieldwork/) blogs.
