In January 2025, a composite team from the University of Oxford and the University of Cape Town deployed to the Kalahari to capture observations of the Kalahari dryline. 

Drylines are strong moisture discontinuties in the atmosphere which are frequnetly associated with convective initiation. Studies have shown that 68% of Kalahari drylines are associated with convection within 100km of the dryline.

However, a lack of observations in the Kalahari means that the structure and maintinance of Kalahari drylines is not well understood. This project set out to collect data that can change that.

The team sampled the Kalahari dryline across 3 intensive observational peroids (IOPs). Two 4x4's proformed transects across the dryline instrumented with Campbell Scientific CR1000 data loggers and sensors for temperature, humidity and pressure.

A radiosonde site was run from Molopo Lodge, Askam, whilst a further vehicle was equipped as a roving radiosonde station, allowing simultanious soundings across the dryline.
