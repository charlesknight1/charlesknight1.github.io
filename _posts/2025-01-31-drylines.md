In January 2025, a composite team from the University of Oxford and the University of Cape Town deployed to the Kalahari to capture observations of the Kalahari dryline.  

Drylines are strong moisture discontinuities in the atmosphere, which are frequently associated with convective initiation. Studies have shown that 68% of Kalahari drylines are associated with convection within 100 km of the dryline.  

However, a lack of observations in the Kalahari means that the structure and maintenance of Kalahari drylines is not well understood. This project set out to collect data that can change that.

The team sampled the Kalahari dryline across three intensive observational periods (IOPs). Two 4x4s performed transects across the dryline, instrumented with Campbell Scientific CR1000 data loggers and sensors for temperature, humidity, and pressure.  

A radiosonde site was run from Molopo Lodge, Askham, whilst another vehicle was equipped as a roving radiosonde station, allowing simultaneous soundings across the dryline.
