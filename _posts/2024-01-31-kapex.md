The Kalahari is warming at over twice the global rate, with climate projections indicating a gradual drying of the Kalahari, leading to more intense droughts. These trends present a profound threat to communities who have lived there for millennia and to the unique desert ecosystems. A crucial driver of these trends is the Kalahari Heat Low.

The Kalahari Heat Low is a low-level low-pressure system, driven by intense surface heating in the Kalahari region. The cyclonic low-pressure circulation alters patterns of winds and moisture for thousands of kilometres, playing a central role in determining the location of rainfall across the subcontinent. The Kalahari heat low is a key feature in the formation of drylines, which create the sharp east-west gradient in rainfall across southern Africa, but exactly how is uncertain. 

The Kalahari Atmospheric Processes Experiment (KAPEX) was a field campaign to collect the first detailed atmospheric observations of the Kalahari Heat Low and understand these dynamics. The project addressed a large gap in climate observations over Africa: while intensive observational campaigns in the Sahara have led to fundamental insights into the regional climate in the north of the continent, there has been no such campaign for the Kalahari – Africa’s second-largest desert.

The project involved four-hourly radiosonde releases from a site just south of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, South Africa. The team, a composite of Oxford and University of Cape Town, also deployed a network of automatic weather stations. Research flights and car-based transects of temperature and dewpoint complemented the suite of observations. James Warner from the UK Met Office fed the field team state-of-the-art daily high-resolution weather forecast data via Whatsapp.

The 43-degree heat was challenging for both personnel and equipment. Radiosondes, ground stations, laptops and the LiDAR all fell victim to overheating, a constant challenge to maintaining regular and consistent observations. A makeshift aircon unit for the LiDAR system constructed from pallets, a desk fan, and some wet towels required constant attention during the heat of the day.
