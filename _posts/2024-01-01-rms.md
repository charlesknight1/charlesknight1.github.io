The [Radcliffe Meteorological Station](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/research/climate/rms) (RMS) holds the longest single-site weather records in the United Kingdom, and amongst the longest in the world. It is maintained by the School of Geography and the Environment, and I have been Lead Observer at the station since September 2023. A team of observers rotates responsibility for readings, recorded at 09:00 UTC on every day of the year.

Meteorological records began at RMS in 1772, with unbroken daily air temperature records from November 1813, daily rainfall from January 1827 and daily sunshine from February 1880. The lead observer is therefore responsible for the upkeep of:
- 76,702 days of continuous daily temperature observations
- 71,965 continuous daily rainfall readings
- 52,696 continuous daily sunshine readings.
