The [Radcliffe Meteorological Station](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/research/climate/rms) (RMS) holds the longest single-site weather records in the United Kingdom, and amongst the longest in the world. It is maintained by the School of Geography and the Environment, and I have been Lead Observer at the station since September 2023. A team of 5 observers take responsibility for readings, which are taken at 09:00 UTC every day of the year.

Meteorological records began at RMS in 1772, with unbroken daily air temperature records from November 1813, daily rainfall from January 1827 and daily sunshine from February 1880. The lead observer is therefore responsible for the upkeep of:
- <script>
    var startDate = new Date("1813-11-01");
    var today = new Date();
    var timeDifference = today.getTime() - startDate.getTime();
    var daysDifference = Math.floor(timeDifference / (1000 * 3600 * 24));
    document.write(daysDifference + " days of continuous daily temperature observations");
  </script>
- <script>
    var startDate = new Date("1827-01-01");
    var today = new Date();
    var timeDifference = today.getTime() - startDate.getTime();
    var daysDifference = Math.floor(timeDifference / (1000 * 3600 * 24));
    document.write(daysDifference + " continuous daily rainfall readings");
  </script>
- <script>
    var startDate = new Date("1880-02-01");
    var today = new Date();
    var timeDifference = today.getTime() - startDate.getTime();
    var daysDifference = Math.floor(timeDifference / (1000 * 3600 * 24));
    document.write(daysDifference + " continuous daily sunshine readings");
  </script>
