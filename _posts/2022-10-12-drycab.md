Southern Africa is one of two land-based areas of the planet where large-scale drying is projected to occur in future decades. The projections tell us that this is expected to result from the late onset of the rains. However, much of what we know about the climate dynamics of this remote region depends on numerical models, and is not grounded in observations

The DRYCAB project aimed to address this observational deficit. A collaboration between the University of Oxford and the Zambian Met Department compiled a comprehensive observational dataset on the onset of the rainy season from August to November 2022.

The fieldwork involved setting up two Lidar systems, one at Solwezi and one at Sakeji Mission School near Ikelenge in far NW Zambia. A total of 800 radiosondes were also released on a 3-hourly timetable, 400 at Nchila (about 3 km from Sakeji) and 400 from Solwezi. A string of AWSs was established in an arc between the two core sites of Nchila and Solwezi. The Oxford field team was based at Nchila, while the Zambian Meteorological Department ran the radiosonde station and Lidar system at Solwezi under the leadership of Wallace Kasongo.
